This is an MCP Server project. Please use https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt for protocol details and examples.

details about the C# MCP SDK is available at https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk

The goal is to wrap Luno API endpoints as MCP tools. Use dependency injection and configuration for Luno API credentials. Please use https://www.luno.com/en/developers/api for API details.

When writing code, ensure it adheres to the ModelContextProtocol standards and is compatible with the Luno API. Focus on creating a robust and testable server implementation that can be easily extended with additional MCP tools in the future.
